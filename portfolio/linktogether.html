            <p>Link Together is designed for our client to improve their internal communication under flat corporate structure. It can better clarify job roles and communicate with other employees. With this tool, employees can find the key person easily and enhance the connection between each other.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Our client is a fast-growing startup company in Ann Arbor. As the company evolve to a larger corporation, it is harder to make balance between communication and effectiveness, causing changes in administration and management strategies. That's what employees said,</p>
            <div class="bubble">
                <div class="talktext">
                    <p>The company not really a startup anymore and it is getting a little bit of a corporate culture.</p>

            <p>Therefore, they come to our school and ask for consulting. In order to finding out the solution, our team chose contextual inquiry as a method. The qualitative research method can help consultants better understand the actual process and how employees perceive the information and react to internal communication.</p>

            <p>There’s unclear hierarchy within the departments, and it is not clear which team members under whose leads. The structure is conflicting to the current meticulous distribution, so it is difficult to clearly define each job role in which office under such a flat structure. That's what employees said,</p>

            <p>As the company expands worldwide, people at different working locations in different time zones may find it is difficult to set person-to-person communication. Moreover, the flat structure problem also occurs in communication between different offices. Interviewees said,</p>

            <p>Our team member conducted interview notes and shared with others in 48 hours after each interview. During the meeting, the interviewer and the note taker interpreted the content of interview, and the other team members would point out the design insights and mark on the notes.</p>
            <img src="assets/linkto_pic1.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>We collected these insights and descriptions, grouped them into several categories, and used 2 more layers to integrate those categories. Finally, we have 2 main categories which are communication tools and corporate culture. </p>
            <img src="assets/linkto_pic2.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>The sub categories of communication tools covered several tools as Slack, email, wiki, video conference and communication guidance.The categories under corporate culture included corporate events, organization, and corporate values. We also studied the related research and analyzed the user behaviors.</p>

            <h3>The Solution</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content col-sm-12">
            <p>In order to solve the problem and support our client to keep growing, we propose 2 solutions to make internal communication become more effective.</p>
            <p>The first step is to create clear job roles and work distribution. Because the company is growing fast, the flat structure may not be able to afford such complicated cooperation. However, most interviewees express they love current startup culture at the company. </p>
            <div class="bubble">
                <div class="talktext">
                    <p>We want to make the company unique. The culture in large company is cold.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="bubble">
                <div class="talktext">
                    <p>I hope people could be free on working in the company.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Therefore, we design a new system to keep both current flat structure and innovative culture. Considering to the bigger and bigger structure, many new employees involved in the company everyday. It is necessary to clarify everyone’s job role and distribution and make new and current employees clearly understand whom to consult with if they need others’ support. </p>
            <p>Nonetheless, it’s not essential to have hierarchy to achieve this result. The ideal solution is to list everyone’s job role, so employees can find the key person who is related to their current job easily. Also, they can mark their preferred contact method on the list and chart, so others can know how to contact with the person effectively. </p>
            <img src="assets/linkto_card.jpg" alt="">
            <p>After the clarification, the relation between each person should be very clear, we can also create a network chart to present the relationship and help employees find the contact person. When user mouse over the dot, it will show the person who is most related to the job role. </p>
            <img src="assets/linkto_link.png" alt="" style="width: 70%;">
            <p>The system can also combine with the contact information to help people contact with other employees directly. It can help employees find correct contact person to solve their real-time problems and communicate with each other. What's the best feature is that they can keep the current flat structure and the corporate culture. </p>
