        <div class="content">
            <p>MomKit is a mobile health app that teaches parents evidence-based breastfeeding techniques with Pixar-style animations. With MomKit, mothers can learn how to alleviate, improve, or prevent the most common breastfeeding problems, from breast pain and engorgement to low milk production and trouble pumping.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>For our client, we worked on 2 different features of their application over the course of 4 months. <br><br><b>1. Breastfeeding Dictionary:</b><br>The Breastfeeding Dictionary feature is integrated into the application and allows mothers to learn more about their body and biology via lactation term definitions at a 6th grade reading level and animated physiology tutorials. <br><br><b>2. Goal Setting Workflow:</b><br>The Goal Setting Workflow needs to be developed so that LGC can answer the question: “How do mothers set goals for themselves while using the application?” An example of a goal is: “I want to breastfeed my baby for 6 months.”</p>

            <p>We initially laid out the the workflow of the application in a flowchart to understand the design better,<br> since the designer in the corporation had designed it. </p>

            <h3>Feature 1 - Breastfeeding Dictionary</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content ">
            <p>The Breastfeeding Dictionary feature is integrated into the application and allows mothers to learn more about their body and biology via lactation term definitions at a 6th grade reading level and animated physiology tutorials. </p>
            <p>The features we thought would be useful in this scenario were: <br><br>- A main search bar <br>- Option to go back to recent searches<br>- Filter feature to look at words that lie under the same theme
            </p>
            <h3>Wireframe</h3>

            <img src="assets/momkit_wireframe2.png " alt=" ">
            <p>During our design critique session with the team, we discussed what other features could be included that would be useful in this case. We thought Favoriting a word could be an option, which could work like “Save later”. Also, we thought a popular searches tab would be useful where users could check what other users are looking for. </p>
            <p>We also discussed the possibility of designing a feature that would allow mothers to share their problems and solutions with other mothers within the app. For example, suppose a mother found a word/massaging technique useful and thought it could be useful to her friend too, she should be able to share it through the application. Hence we decided to provide a “Share” option. </p>

            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <h4>Task</h4>
            <p>- Searching for a word<br>- Sharing the word and related massage techniques<br>- Filtering terms<br> - Looking for favorited terms<br>
            </p>
            <h4>Findings</h4>
            <p>A. Filter Function<br><br>When asked to search for all terms related to “First latch” the user did not think of filtering. Also, the filter icon wasn’t prominent enough to catch their attention. When told about the filter function, she immediately said “the filter feature totally makes sense to me”.</p>
            <div class="bubble ">
                <div class="talktext ">
                    <p>The filter feature totally makes sense to me.</p>
                </div>

            </div>
            <div class="bubble ">
                <div class="talktext ">
                    <p>If a mother doesn’t know what exact word to look for, but knows what the word is related to, the filter function is really useful.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                B. Share Function<br><br>An interesting question came up in one of the user tests when we asked the user to share the word with a friend. The user asked, “What happens if I share a word/related massage technique with a friend who doesn’t have this app?” And this is something that we brought up to the LiquidGoldConcept team to think about. Since the app is going to be purchased through hospitals and clinics and will not be available on the app store, there has to be a way for users to share information or buy the app if they don’t have it.

            <h4>Recommendations</h4>
            <p>We made 3 design recommendations for making the filter function more prominent and obvious to the user:</p>
            <div class="text ">
                <p>1. Explicitly saying “Filter” rather than putting an icon on the interface.</p>
                <img src="assets/momkit_solution1.png " alt=" ">

            </div>

            <div class="text ">
                <p>2. A drop down filter function when the user clicks on the search bar</p>
                <img src="assets/LGC_dictionary_filter.gif " alt=" ">
            </div>

            <div class="text ">
                <p>3. Use tiles of different filter themes rather than a list of words</p>
                <img src="assets/FilterFunction.jpeg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>We suggested that the LGC team could use the same user testing script we used for user testing to test these designs, and make a decision as to which one is most intuitive. </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="part " id="goal_setting ">
        <div class="title center ">
            <h3>Feature 2 - Goal Setting</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content ">
            <p>The "Goal Setting " function can help moms better understand their current status and be more willing to explore and use the application. Also, the user can customize some aspects of the goal for example the time period of the goal. </p>
            <h3>Wireframe</h3>

            <h3>Prototype</h3>
            <img src="assets/momkit_prototype1.png " alt=" ">
            <h3>Interactive Prototype</h3>
            <iframe src="https://marvelapp.com/4ej616j?emb=1 " width="100% " height="100% " allowTransparency="true " frameborder="0 "></iframe>
            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <p>We created a user testing script for the goal framing workflow, and handed it over to the LGC team so they could perform testing and validate the design. The things we would like to test on are: </p>
            <p>- Navigating to goal setting page<br>- Adding a new goal<br>- Checking how many videos the user has already watched for a goal<br>- Deleting a goal</p>
            <p>One suggestion we had for the design was to give the user the ability to add a “Personalized” goal as against a predefined goal. We included some follow up questions in the testing script to validate if adding a personalized goal is a real world scenario. </p>
