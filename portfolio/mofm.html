            <p>Millions of Memories is based on the idea to have fun, so our team also tried to use gachapon as another interface. There is a question and a piece of puzzles at each capsule. Once you turn the key, one of the capsules will drop down. Users can open the capsule and ask one question, and the machine will start to record players' voice automatically. We hope to share happiness and cherish memories with every player in Millions of Memories through different kinds of interfaces.</p>
